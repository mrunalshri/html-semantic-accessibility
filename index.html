      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
        accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
        designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
        and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
        different user needs. Designing pages that are accessible for everyone
        shouldn’t be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have
        collated an ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check
        these criteria off the list!

      <h4>Accessibility Checks:</h4>
      <p>
        Heading elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used to
        represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that allow
        page navigation from heading to heading. Re-size Text: You can vary text
        size by using your browser's text resize settings (through Options or
        Preferences), text-only zoom, page zoom (which also zooms images,
        buttons etc) without incurring styling issues / text over-lapping or
        being cut off the page. Alternative text for images: All images have
        been given appropriate alternative text. Link text: All hyperlinks
        should make sense when read out of context, and hyperlinks are clearly
        presented in a different text style from normal body text. If a link
        opens in a new browser page, it has been labelled as doing so.
        JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for
        navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put in
        place in case your browser does not support these scripts. Colour
        contrast: has been checked for text and background colour combinations
        to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have also ensured that
        information is not referenced by colour alone. Style sheets: If style
        sheets are not supported or are turned off, information on the site can
        still be accessed and read. Forms: forms are marked up correctly so
        people can interact with them using only the keyboard, voice input or
        screen readers. The form labels themselves are clickable, increasing the
        target area and making it easier to select small radio buttons of
        checkboxes.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of
        the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works for
        everyone.
